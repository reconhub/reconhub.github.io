The **R** **E**pidemics **Con**sortium (RECON) is not-for-profit,
non-governmental organisation gathering international experts in data science,
modelling methodology, public health, and software development to create the
**next generation of analytics tools** for **informing the response to disease
outbreaks, health emergencies and humanitarian crises*, using the [R
software](https://www.r-project.org/) and other free, open-source resources.

This includes packages specifically designed for handling, visualising, and
analysing outbreak data using cutting-edge statistical methods, as well as more
general-purpose tools for data cleaning, versioning, and encryption, and system
infrastructure.

Our packages must fulfil three key aspects:

- *Efficiency*: our tools can be used in real time to improve situation
  awareness and inform intervention strategies.

- *Reliability*: our tools are thoroughly and constantly tested using
  professional software development methods.

- *Accessibility*: our tools are free, open-source, and available on virtually
  any platform; they can be used with different levels of expertise, and provide
  graphical user interfaces implementing the most important functionalities.

Besides its active involvement in the creation of tools, RECON is also
increasingly dedicated to:

- *disseminating knowledge*: RECON is developing a new training platform, and a
   series of workshops and short courses on epidemics analysis and outbreak
   response. Our [public forum ](/forum) is also dedicated to sharing exptertise
   on these topics.

- *outbreak response deployment*: RECON supports the deployment of data analysts
   to the field as part of outbreak response teams; this includes the deployment
   of staff as well as analysis systems adapted to low resources settings.


<br> As of 19th September 2018, RECON is a non-profit, incorporated association
regulated by the French law, in accordance to the association law of 1st July
1901 and the decree of the 16th August 1901. For more information about the
remit of RECON, check our [official statutes](documents/statutes_en_1.1.pdf).
