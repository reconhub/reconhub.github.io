<p>There are multiple ways to get involved with RECON</p>

<ul>
  <li>Subscribe our <em>email announcements list</em> to keep up with our activities and learn
about development, training, or deployment opportunities. Sign up with the
<a href="#online-application-form">form below</a>.</li>
  <li>Join our <a href="https://reconhub.slack.com/"><em>Slack workspace</em></a> to chat with others involved in RECON activities

</ul>

<h2 id="becoming-a-member">Becoming a member</h2>

<h3 id="who-are-our-members">Who are our members?</h3>

<p><a href="../people">Our members</a> form the backbone of RECON. They are actively involved in the
development of analytics tools, contribute free and open training material, run
our workshops, teach at our short courses, or are deployed to the field where
they battle-test our resources to inform the response to disease outbreaks,
health emergencies, and humanitarian crises. Through votes at our annual General
Assembly, they can shape activities of RECON, and are also elligible for roles
in the Executive Board.</p>

<h3 id="why-become-a-member">Why become a member?</h3>

<p>Members benefit from a number of advantages; they can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>attend general assemblies to shape the activities of RECON</li>
  <li>have free access to the RECON mailing lists and forums</li>
  <li>advertise their work, when in line with the remit of RECON, on the association
media, including newsletters, mailing lists, discussion forums, blogs and
websites</li>
  <li>possess a confidential list of other RECON members to facilitate networking
within the association</li>
  <li>attend meetings not otherwise open to the public, such as internal training
workshops, hackathons and retreats organised by the association</li>
  <li>typically get a discount on RECON events where a registration fee applies</li>
  <li>apply for, and benefit from internal resources of RECON (e.g. funding,
equipment)</li>
  <li>(contributing members) vote at general assemblies to shape the activities of RECON</li>
  <li>(contributing members) be candidates to any post of the executive board during its election</li>
</ul>

<p>Benefits to members are formally defined in <em>Article 5.4</em> of our 
<a href="documents/statutes_en_1.2.pdf">statutes</a></p>

<h3 id="how-to-become-a-member">How to become a member?</h3>

<p>RECON aims to gather a community of people actively involved in the development
of free analytics resources to inform the response to disease outbreaks, health
emergencies, and humanitarian crises. Beyond the development of analytics tools,
this also includes people contributing to training and capacity building, and
people battle-testing our resources in the field.</p>

<p>Anyone can apply to become a <em>regular member</em> of RECON, in order to be involved in
RECON projects and events. <em>Contributing members</em> need to have made a contribution
in any of the areas of RECON activities including software development, training
and capacity building, or field deployment. See 
<a href="https://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/documents/statutes_en_1.2.pdf">our statutes</a> 
for more details on contributions; below is a quick summary:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>software development</em>: you made a substantial contribution to RECON packages
(hosted at https://github.com/reconhub), either through new functions, new
automated tests, documented datasets, or by contributing new documentation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>training and capacity building</em>: you contributed training material,
typically on https://reconlearn.org, taught at one of our short courses, or
co-organised a RECON workshop or a similar event using RECON materials</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>field deployment</em>: you battle-tested our resources during a deployment <em>in
country</em> to respond to a disease outbreak, a health emergency, or a
humanitarian crisis</p>
  </li>
</ul>
