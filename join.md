## Who can join?

RECON aims to gather a community of people actively involved in the development of R packages for outbreak response. We are also welcoming experienced R developers as well as public health officers specialised in outbreak response.


## What does 'joining' mean?

Members have no obligation towards RECON. The ownership of any published material remains with their author(s).

Members of RECON will:

- be able to advertise their packages and relevant publications on this website
- be able to publish posts on the [RECON blog](../blog)
- be able to use the [Resources](../resources) section to share data, scripts, and teaching material
- be automatically invited to the [RECON forum](../forum), which will host private and public discussions relating to outbreak analysis, modelling, and R programming
- benefit from the expertise of other members in R package development
- be invited to future RECON events (depending on practical constraints)
- be able to host their package on the [RECON github organization](https://github.com/reconhub/), although this is by no way mandatory
